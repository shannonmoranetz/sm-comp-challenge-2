# Static Comp 2
## Shannon Moranetz

This page was created using several layout techniques, combining all CSS and HTML knowledge learned in Mod 1. The greater page layout was structured using grid, and individual elements within swere styled using flexbox as needed. Several breakpoints were added in order to create a responsive layout throughout the page.
